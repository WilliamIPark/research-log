This is a blog owned by William Park, a student of Interaction Design, taught at Belfast School of Art.</p>\n<h2>What is this blog?</h2>\n<p>This blog is a small area of the internet for me to post my thoughts and research while creating my final project. It’s somewhat of a digital scrapbook. You could find anything here from ideas that I’ve had, to snippets from material I’ve been taking in as research.</p>\n<p>The layout of this blog could change over time as I put more time into it, to keep the site’s content easy to digest.</p>\n<h2>What is my final project about?</h2>\n<p>Keeping in mind that this is the <em>first post</em> and the project idea can and mostly will change in ways, the general idea I’m working on is to build a native application that helps its users build and keep habits. I’ll talk about the general idea in another post.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome","date":"October 03, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-is-this.1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-this/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome"}}}}
