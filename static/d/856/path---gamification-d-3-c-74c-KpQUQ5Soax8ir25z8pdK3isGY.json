I also want to use it as a form of slowly building the habit of using the app by keeping goals managable.</p>\n<p>In my research for habits I found that one of the reasons a lot of people quit is because they take on too much. For example, someone starts a diet and remove too many calories from their allowance in order to lose weight faster, making the process too difficult and it results in them quitting. This is obviously not something I want to happen when people are using my app.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gamification","date":"October 30, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Gamification/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/competition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Competition"}},"next":null}}
