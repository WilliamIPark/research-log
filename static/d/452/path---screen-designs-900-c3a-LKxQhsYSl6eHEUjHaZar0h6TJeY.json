I do not mind paying a small amount of money for a refined app with a good experience and no advertisments. Also having to pay for an app has generally made me feel like the creator of that app has more confidence in what they’ve built, which has usually lead to a better experience. </p>\n<p>Having it priced as such means I can give discounts at key moments, such as launch, to gain a user base. It means the product I’m delivering is something that I’m happy to have people installing on their phones without worrying advertisers are showing experience ruining content.</p>\n<p>I could avoid all these things by making the app free, but I would like to continue supporting it in the future using the money earned.</p>\n<p>I also considered making the app free with an in-app purchase to unlock a premium version which allows you to create more habits, but I think this goes against what I’m trying to achieve with my main gamification loop that I wrote about in the previous post.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Screen Designs","date":"November 03, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/screen-designs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/animation-style/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Animation Style Experiment"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/pricing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pricing"}}}}
