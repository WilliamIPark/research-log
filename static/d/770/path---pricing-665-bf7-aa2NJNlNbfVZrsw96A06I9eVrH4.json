I do not mind paying a small amount of money for a refined app with a good experience and no advertisments. Also having to pay for an app has generally made me feel like the creator of that app has more confidence in what they’ve built, which has usually lead to a better experience. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pricing","date":"November 07, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pricing/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gamification/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gamification"}},"next":null}}
