I also want to use it as a form of slowly building the habit of using the app by keeping goals managable.</p>\n<p>In my research for habits I found that one of the reasons a lot of people quit is because they take on too much. For example, someone starts a diet and remove too many calories from their allowance in order to lose weight faster, making the process too difficult and it results in them quitting. This is obviously not something I want to happen when people are using my app.</p>\n<h2>The Main Gamification Loop</h2>\n<p>I’ve came up with the idea of a main gamification loop that I want the user to experience. I want to combine the idea of streaks, along with the idea of unlocking additional “habit slots” to drive investment into the app, as well as a gradual increase in usage.</p>\n<h3>Terminology</h3>\n<p>Let me explain what I mean by “streak” and “habit slot”.</p>\n<p><strong>Streak:</strong> The number of days in a row where <strong>all</strong> habits have been completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Habit Slot:</strong> The number of habits the user is allowed to track in the app.</p>\n<h3>The Loop</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>User completes a month worth of streaks. <em>Adding value / investing time.</em></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gamification","date":"October 30, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Gamification/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/competition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Competition"}},"next":null}}
