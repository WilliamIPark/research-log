During the chat people always mention that they have something they want to improve on in their life, or that it would be useful for them. These people have mostly been young adults aged around 25, but I’ve talked to people who are interested in the idea, who are as young as 19.</p>\n<p>When talking to them the biggest concern for them, when they try to attempt something without aid is that they lose motivation. One person said that this was because there’s no immediate reward, and a another said that it was because they find it hard to see any progress. This is great news, because these were the problems I initally seen myself, and these are the problems I’ll want to solve with the app.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"User Research","date":"October 15, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/user-research/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/user-surveys/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"User Surveys Launched"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/user-personas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"User Personas"}}}}
