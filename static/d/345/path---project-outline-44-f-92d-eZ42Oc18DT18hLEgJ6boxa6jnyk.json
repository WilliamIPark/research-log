A habit, by definition, is something that you do often and regularly. This means forming a habit is no easy task without repeated focus. The problem is this repeated focus to build a habit can be hard to keep if you’re forgetful, busy, or even lazy.</p>\n<p>This app will aim to use gamification hooks to pull people back to the repeated focus of creating their habit until the habit exists and fuels itself. Currently, my idea involves users earning virtual currency (but not crypto!) for keeping to their habits and spending that currency on rewards that users set up themselves. (But there’s no reason this couldn’t be expanded later to allow users to earn real rewards, like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sweatcoin-sweat-for-coin/id971023427?mt=8\">Sweatcoin</a>). For example, if you kept to your diet habit 6 days a week, on the 7th day you can unlock a reward that allows you to treat yourself to a Chinese. Of course, you could buy a Chinese without that - but shame on that user!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Project Outline","date":"October 04, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-outline/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-this/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome"}}}}
