Hello there. This is a blog owned by William Park, a student of Interaction Design, taught at Belfast School of Art.

##What is this blog?
This blog is a small area of the internet for me to post my thoughts and research while creating my final project. It's somewhat of a digital scrapbook. You could find anything here from ideas that I've had, to snippets from material I've been taking in as research.

The layout of this blog could change over time as I put more time into it, to keep the site's content easy to digest.

##What is my final project about?
Keeping in mind that this is the _first post_ and the project idea can and mostly will change in ways, the general idea I'm working on is to build a native application that helps its users build and keep habits.

You can read more about the idea of the project in [this post](../project-outline).
